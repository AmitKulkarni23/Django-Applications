Chapter_2

Products Component
- Storing the datat
- Displaying products in a list
- Get data from database / save data in database


--------------------

First App module

Django Web application that is comprised of a number of apps

$ python manage.py startapp 

An app handles and handles one thing well
For example:
Product -> Can have 1 product and multiple categories


Put this settings.py -> INSTALLED_APPS list

--------------------

Understanding CRUD

Create - POST
Retrieve / List / Search - GET
Update - PUT / Patch / POST
Delete - Delete

CRUD - handles database related actions


--------------------

Product Model


Model -> How we are going to connect Django with database
NAME YOUR MODEL AS A SINGULAR ITEM


CharField -> limit characters
TextField -> a lot more data



$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ Python manage.py migrate

When you add a new field to your database and run makemigrations, you get an error
"You are trying to add a non-nullable field "price" to product without a default.

Even though we haven't created any item in the database, Django complains of thsi error

So, when you run makemigrations Django doesn;t make any call to the database, but checks teh migrations folder which has
"initial.py" file present. There are initial fields present in the initial.py file


NOTE: You have to register your model
In product/admin.py

from .models import Product
admin.site.register(Product)

--------------------


Class Based View

from django.views.generic.list import ListView


For class based view:
The default template is present under product/products_list.html


But class based view doesn't have a context
class ProductListView(ListView):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()

    def get_context_data(self, *args, object_list=None, **kwargs):
        """
        This is a method that is provided by Django.Every single class based view has this context
        :param object_list: 
        :param kwargs:
        :return:
        """
        context = super(ProductListView, self).get_context_data(*args, **kwargs)
        return context
		

{'paginator': None, 'page_obj': None, 'is_paginated': False, 'object_list': <QuerySet [<Product: T-Shirt>, <Product: Hat>]>, 'product_list': <QuerySet [<Product: T-Shirt>, <Product: Hat>]>, 'view': <products.vi
ews.ProductListView object at 0x000002CA458DAF98>}


Therefore, in your template:
{% for object in object_list %}
    {{ object.title }} <br/>

{% endfor %}

--------------------

DetailView


Regular Expressions in Django
https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/common-regular-expressions-for-django-urls/


Example:
class ProductDetailView(DetailView):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    template_name = "products/detail.html"
	
and your URL is:
products/(?P<pk>\d+)/$ -> Named capturing group if (?P) is used -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7988942/what-does-this-django-regex-mean-p
\d -> Match character class
+ -> means 1 or more expression
) -> end of capture group


pk is being passed in


--------------------


Image Filed and File Field

We want our products to be a visual thing
Upload images to a product


image = models.FileField(upload_to="products/") -> Uploads to media root
null = True, blank = True

null -> in the database it can be an empty value
blank -> not required in Django


Can use ImageField and FileField to upload and download files

--------------------

Understanding Lookups


how do you actually lookup things in a dB?

$ python manage.py shell

qs = Product.objects.all()
hat = qs.filter(title__contains="Hat")


qs.filter(description__contains="Hat")


NOTE: Use icontains -> for case-insensitivity


How to chain these?
qs.filter(description__contains="Hat", title__iexact="Hat")


.get() lookup will be same as filter
But get() lookup will raise a DoesNotExist error

whereas filter will return an empty list


--------------------

Custom Model Managers


Ability to call a queryset on a model
- doing it because of objects
- objects is a model manager
- like get call on model
- filter -> model manager method

Model manager easier to do lookups

In models.py

class ProductManager(models.Manager):
    def get_by_id(self, id):
        qs = self.get_queryset().filter(id=id)
        if qs.count() == 1:
            return qs.first()
        return None

		
--------------------


Featured and Custom Querysets


--------------------


Slug Fields and Signals

Slug -> short label
Eg: taking a title and making it user friendly

NOTE: Admin panel

class ProductAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ["__str__", "slug"]

    class Meta:
        model = Product


admin.site.register(Product, ProductAdmin)



class ProductSlugView(DetailView):
	template_name = "products/detail.html"
	query_set = Products.objects.all()
	
http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/ctci/ -> Now this will work

GET through slugs might return an exception -> MultipleObjectsReturned

Therefore, we want our slugs to be unique
In models.py add the unique field

Checkout unique slug generator at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47961349/unique-slug-generator

--------------------


Product URLs

In models.py
def get_absolute_url(self):
	return f"/products/{self.slug}"

{% for object in object_list %}
    <a href="{{ object.get_absolute_url }}">{{ object.title }}</a> <br/>

{% endfor %}
