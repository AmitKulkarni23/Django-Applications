Cart Component

========================

Cart App

-> Will be handling all of the shopping carts for authenticated and non-authenticated users



========================

Django Sessions

Whether you are a logged in user or not when you select
certain products and add them to cart they should be persistent

django.contrib.sessions 

When you go to a website it starts a session
That session expires when the developer says that it expires

Session -> remember things done in a session

Can be used for a user name

Sessions -> based off of your dB.
Sessions are stored in your dB


request.session -> SessionStore

request.session.set_expiry

request.session.session_key


We will be playing around with setting and getting session variables
request.session["first_name"] = "Amit"

In home_view
print(request.session.get("first_name")

Therefore, request.session -> is a dictionary


request.user["user"] = request.user
-> Error: AnonymousUser is not JSON serializable

You can't save actual objects to a session

string, integer
