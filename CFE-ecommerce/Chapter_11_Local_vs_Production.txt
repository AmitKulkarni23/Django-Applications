Local vs Production_Environment

Why do we want 2 different environments?

- Debugging
- Releases ( Testing locally, we are not ready to deploy yet)
- Also dev environments( We wnat to setup different settings model)

=================================================

kirr.co/8mjnna

=================================================

Move settings.py into a module
Call that folder ( or module ) settings - this is necessary

Rename the existing settings.py -> base.py

Every settings.py we use in the future we want to base it off of base.py

Move base.py into the settings folder.

__init__.py -> Python when it goes into the module it looks in __init__.py file first



BASE_DIR - what is this?

The root of our Django project is where manage.py is

settings.py -> E:\\SelfLearning\\Mozilla\\locallibrary\\Django-Applications\\CFE-ecommerce\\ecommerce\\ecommerce
manage.py -> E:\SelfLearning\Mozilla\locallibrary\Django-Applications\CFE-ecommerce\ecommerce\manage.py

Therefore,

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

Updated our settings where our manage.py is

=================================================

Multiple Settings Module

We can add any number of settings modules

settings/__init__.py

from .base import *
from .local import *
from .production import *


By default we want our production done correctly

Therefore in our settings/__init__.py file we do something like:


from .base import *
from .production import *

try:
    from .local import *
except:
    pass



This means that if we are facing any error in the local file, just ignore it and go off of production

Note for production files -> 
DEBUG = FALSE
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] -> Thi should be changed


When we go live, we will not even bring the local files
ORDERING IS IMPORTANT

production should be the last thing imported - for a production environment

=================================================

Prepare for HTTPS

In the past, having a secure site was expensive
Now its free because of Let's Encrypt

kirr.co/vklau5 - SSL/TLS settings for Django

=================================================

The gitignore file

kirr.co/moo1b0

=================================================

Requirements file

- Do a pip freeze from your manage.py
- This will list out a number of packages with their version numbers


=================================================

Setup Git Version Control

=================================================

Deploy to Heroku


Heroku - helps us to take care of our code and then takes care of serving the code


$ heroku login


$ heroku create <project-name>

heroku  https://git.heroku.com/amit-new-ecommerce.git (fetch)
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/amit-new-ecommerce.git (push)


Now these are heroku remotes.
These are empty when you create the app

If you want the remotes to have the same git repository as your app is in then run "heroku create <app-name>" from teh root of your git repo

Step 1)
Procfile
In this Procfile just enter
web: gunicorn dj-project.wsgi


Step 2)
Install some of packages related to Heroku
psycopg2 - PostgreSQL python wrapper
dj-database-url
gunicorn


NEXT
Add python runtime

$ python -V

Create a file called runtime.txt


We need Heroku to have our database


heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev


We need to update our production settings to use PostgreSQL database installed in Heroku


Before pushing to heroku, disable collect static
$ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1



DESTROYING AN APP ON HEROKU
$ heroku detsroy:apps <app-name>

IF THERE IS A GIT REMOTE RELATED TO SUCH AN APP THAT SHOULD BE DELETD AS WELL
git remote rm heroku


NEED TO SET A HEROKU buildpack
$ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/python


THEN, we need to run migrations on Heroku
$ heroku run python manage.py migrate

=================================================

Need to update CORS configuration
What is CORS? - Cross origin resource sharing

Although you may not notice it, the web pages you visit make frequent requests to load assets like 
images, fonts, and more, from many different places across the Internet. If these requests for 
assets go unchecked, the security of your browser may be at risk. For example, 
your browser may be subject to hijacking, or your browser might blindly download malicious code. 
As a result, many modern browsers follow security policies to mitigate such risks.


A request for a resource (like an image or a font) outside of the origin is known as a 
cross-origin request. CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) manages cross-origin requests.


boto and boto3 -> AWS python bindings
django-storages -> How we are going to handle our static files to be sent to AWS



NEXT STEP: Add the third part applications storages to your settings.py file ( To all base.py, local.py and production.py)

$ python manage.py migrate



Cereate a new aws folder under ecommerce


ecommerce
	aws
		- __init__.py
		- utils.py
		
utils.py

from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

StaticRootS3BototoStorage = lambda : S3Boto3Storage(location="static")
MediaRootS3BototoStorage = lambda : S3Boto3Storage(location="media")

Create folders in your bucket "static" and "media"



conf.py in newly created aws module


AWS_GROUP_NAME = "Amit-HomeFoods"
AWS_USER_NAME = "amit-homefoods"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_IDS = "AKIAYVVU5ZWXMRPE3S24"
AWS_SECRET_KEY = "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"



How does django storages query?
All of the variable names are present in the documentation
