Templates
- eliminate repetitiveness in HTML documents

=====================

Base Template

base.html -> main spot where all of our content will inherit from

extends tag

=====================

Include Tag

- include other html p[ages into your HTML page

=====================

Pass arguments with include

- passing variables along with the include tag
- these variables can be actual context dictionary variables

Example:
{% include "base/navbar.html" with brand_name="eCommerce"%}


=====================

Reusable Live Snippets


Bootstrap Cards

-> Similar to include with tag

=====================


Reverse for URLs

reverse -> works in templates
reverse -> also works in models

Templates
- You can do something like:
<a href="{% url 'detail' slug=instance.slug%}" class="btn btn-warning">URL shortcut</a>

and teh actual URL could be:
re_path(r"^(?P<slug>[\w-]+)/$", ProductDetailSlugView.as_view(), name="detail")

In Models:
def get_absolute_url(self):
	# return f"/products/{self.slug}"
	return reverse("detail", kwargs={"slug": self.slug})


But, you should ad namespacing here
